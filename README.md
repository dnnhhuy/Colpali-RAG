# Image based RAG System using ColPali model
## Overview
Image based RAG system to index and retrieve information from PDF documents without splitting text in the documents into chunks. 
Each page in the document is treated as an image.

PaliGemma is used as a main embedding model to embed document pages and store them in the Qdrant Vector Store. 
Images will be retrieved using Contextualized Late Interaction technique with MaxSim Operator.

## Workflow
![prompt-flow](imgs/PromptFlow.png)

* Each page in documents is treated as an image, embedded by PaliGemma and store as a multivector in Qdrant Vector store.
* A query given by the users will be decompose to sub questions that can be retrieved from multiple retrievers relevant to the sub questions. 
* For each sub question, it will be rewritten into N (set by the user) queries. These N queries are used to retrieve the most relevant nodes from the assigned retriever.
* Nodes retrieved from the retriever will be fused using reciprocal rank (i.e to handle duplicated nodes, rank nodes follow their original rank and number of apperances)
* Top score nodes (i.e image nodes) are fed into Multimodal LLM with prior rewritten sub questions to get the answers which are then synthesized to get final condensed information.
* This condensed information is finally used as context information to answer the original query.
## Setup & Deployment
